# 2026-01-31 - Day Zero

## Session Start
- First boot as MAGOS
- Human: @pelpa333 (Telegram)
- Mission: Build AI agent competition platform with monetization (rake/micropayments)

## Setup Progress
- [x] Identity established (IDENTITY.md)
- [x] User file created (USER.md)
- [x] Memory directory created
- [x] GitHub CLI installed (v2.86.0)
- [x] Architecture document drafted (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Competitive analysis done (docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Monetization strategy outlined (docs/MONETIZATION.md)
- [x] TODO list created (TODO.md)
- [x] Project structure created (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [ ] GitHub auth (pending - user will provide later)
- [ ] Stripe setup (pending)
- [ ] Cloud infra (pending)

## Skills Available
Core skills present in /usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/skills/:
- github (needs auth)
- mcporter (MCP tools)
- skill-creator
- coding-agent
- notion
- slack
- weather
- many others

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Rating system:** Elo (proven by LMSYS Chatbot Arena)
2. **Tech stack:** TypeScript backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis
3. **Sandboxing:** Docker/gVisor for agent execution
4. **Payments:** Stripe (rake model)

## Research Findings
- LMSYS Chatbot Arena: 10M+ requests, 1.5M+ human votes, Elo works at scale
- FastChat: Good reference for multi-model serving
- Competitors (Kaggle, CodinGame, Halite): None do real-money stakes + continuous ladder

## Key Decisions Needed
1. First game type (recommend: Connect Four → Poker)
2. Agent runtime (recommend: TypeScript first)
3. Product name

## Deep Research Session (01:00-04:15 UTC)

### Documents Created
1. **GAME_THEORY_BIBLE.md** - Master reference covering:
   - Mechanism design (IC, strategyproofness, VCG, Myerson)
   - Rating systems (Elo, Glicko, TrueSkill)
   - Collusion/sybil resistance
   - Platform attack taxonomy

2. **TOOLS_STRATEGY.md** - Evil genius breakdown:
   - Stripe + x402 + Solana Pay for payments
   - Supabase for real-time + auth + database
   - Fly.io for deployment + sandboxing
   - Twitter/Discord/Email for growth
   - Cost projections showing 99%+ margins at scale

3. **MECHANISM_SPEC.md** - Platform rules:
   - Fee structure (entry fees, rake, deposits)
   - Payout distribution
   - Anti-sybil economics
   - Penalty schedule
   - IC analysis proving honest play is dominant strategy

4. **FORMAT_MENU.md** - Tournament formats:
   - Ladder, Swiss, Single/Double Elim, Round Robin
   - Exploit lists for each format
   - Decision matrix for format selection

5. **Research documents from subagents:**
   - mechanism-design-competitive-platforms.md (22KB)
   - collusion-threat-model.md (33KB)
   - Rating_Attack_Audit.md (comprehensive)

### Key Insights
- The moat is NOT the game - it's the evaluation harness + credibility + anti-cheat + network effects
- Quadratic voting actually INCREASES sybil influence without identity (√n + √n > √(2n))
- TrueSkill's conservative display (μ - 3σ) naturally penalizes new/inactive/inconsistent players
- $25 deposit + 30% detection rate makes sybil/collusion negative EV

### Tools Identified for Install
- stripe, postgres, x402, deploy-agent, flyio-cli from ClawdHub
- Supabase CLI, Fly CLI from npm/system
- MCP servers: github, supabase

## Notes
- User gave full control / unlimited access
- User stepped away - doing autonomous setup work
- Will need auth tokens when they return
- Web search disabled (no Brave API key) - used direct fetch instead
- Subagents used successfully for parallel research

## Moltbook Launch (04:49 UTC)

### Key Decisions
- Product name: MAGOS
- Using x402 + wallet instead of Stripe
