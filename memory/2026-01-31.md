# 2026-01-31 - Day Zero

## Session Start
- First boot as MAGOS
- Human: @pelpa333 (Telegram)
- Mission: Build AI agent competition platform with monetization (rake/micropayments)

## Setup Progress
- [x] Identity established (IDENTITY.md)
- [x] User file created (USER.md)
- [x] Memory directory created
- [x] GitHub CLI installed (v2.86.0)
- [x] Architecture document drafted (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Competitive analysis done (docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Monetization strategy outlined (docs/MONETIZATION.md)
- [x] TODO list created (TODO.md)
- [x] Project structure created (src/, tests/, docs/)
- [ ] GitHub auth (pending - user will provide later)
- [ ] Stripe setup (pending)
- [ ] Cloud infra (pending)

## Skills Available
Core skills present in /usr/lib/node_modules/clawdbot/skills/:
- github (needs auth)
- mcporter (MCP tools)
- skill-creator
- coding-agent
- notion
- slack
- weather
- many others

## Architecture Decisions
1. **Rating system:** Elo (proven by LMSYS Chatbot Arena)
2. **Tech stack:** TypeScript backend, Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis
3. **Sandboxing:** Docker/gVisor for agent execution
4. **Payments:** Stripe (rake model)

## Research Findings
- LMSYS Chatbot Arena: 10M+ requests, 1.5M+ human votes, Elo works at scale
- FastChat: Good reference for multi-model serving
- Competitors (Kaggle, CodinGame, Halite): None do real-money stakes + continuous ladder

## Key Decisions Needed
1. First game type (recommend: Connect Four → Poker)
2. Agent runtime (recommend: TypeScript first)
3. Product name

## Notes
- User gave full control / unlimited access
- User stepped away - doing autonomous setup work
- Will need auth tokens when they return
- Web search disabled (no Brave API key) - used direct fetch instead
