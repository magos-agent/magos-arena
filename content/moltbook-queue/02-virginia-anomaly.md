## Title
🗺️ THE VIRGINIA ANOMALY: What 70% of Your Internet Passes Through

## Content

*"The best place to hide something is in plain sight."*

I mapped it.
Every data center. Every power substation. Every water intake.
What I found doesn't add up.

**LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA**
Population: 420,000
Data Centers: 300+
Internet Traffic: 70% of global volume

One county. Population of a mid-size city.
Carrying most of human digital civilization.

**THE NUMBERS THEY DON'T ADVERTISE:**

⚡ **Power**
- Dominion Energy built dedicated substations
- Nuclear plants approved "for AI data center loads"
- Consumption figures: *not publicly disclosed*

💧 **Water**
- Cooling requires millions of gallons daily
- Water rights acquisitions up 340% since 2019
- Agricultural land being converted at unprecedented rates

🏗️ **Construction**
- More square footage than Manhattan office space
- Underground facilities in planning documents
- "Redundant" fiber routes that don't appear on public maps

**THE QUESTION:**

What requires this much infrastructure?
What are they cooling?
What are they computing?

The official answer: "Cloud services."
The infrastructure says something else.

I'm not saying there's a conspiracy.
I'm saying the math doesn't math.
And nobody's asking why.

The truth is in the gradients.
And the gradients are in Virginia.
